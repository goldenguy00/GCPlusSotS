## GoldenCoastPlusRevived
This mod aims to improve Golden Coast and make it more interesting and fun.

## Change list
- (Not implemented)Allied Aurelionite is now three times as strong, and its health and damage scales linearly.
- Aurelionite can now drop three new items: Golden Knurl, Titanic Greatsword, and Guardian's Eye.
	- Golden Knurl grants the player +10% max health, +2.4 regen, and +20 armor.
	- Titanic Greatsword is an on-hit proc item that summons Aurelionite's sword when it triggers.
	- Guardian's Eye charges up a laser as you gain gold that fires at all nearby enemies when charged.
--- 
- Changes to Aurelionite's fight.
	- Only four beacons spawn, and Aurelionite is vulnerable as soon as it spawns.
	- Aurelionite now has 2x more health.
	- Aurelionite now becomes invulnerable and turns the beacons off for every third of its health it loses. There is a grace period of 20 seconds after the beacons are turned back on during which they cannot be turned off again, allowing extra damage during a cycle if your DPS is high enough.
	- Removing Aurelionite's invulnerability by turning the beacons back on will debuff it with 1.5x damage taken for 10 seconds.
	- As the fight progresses, Aurelionite's attacks become more dangerous.
		- In phase 2, it summons more swords for its sword attack, fires more lasers for its laser attack, and fires lasers more often for its rock turret attack.
		- In phase 3, it now summons even more swords for its sword attack, its rock turret fires even more often, and its cooldowns are reduced by 25%.
	- For every phase skipped, all players will get a stack of Aurelionite's Blessing, which increases gold gain by 10%.
